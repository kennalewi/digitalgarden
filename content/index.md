Hello, my name is Kenna and I'm a student at the University of Cincinnati studying to recieve my Bachelors of Fine Arts. I also received my Associates of Applied Business, in Applied Graphic Communications at the University of Cincinnati Blue Ash.

This is my [[Digital Garden]], where I engage in [[Learning in Public]].

I am currently exploring [[Post Internet Art]], as well as some other topics. I'm learning a lot about [[3D Printing]], and have been experimenting with [[Making 3D models]].
