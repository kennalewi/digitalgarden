I presented the idea of the panopticon and the post internet
- in a way, panopticon might not be the best analogy because we cannot see who's in the middle
- look into exploring the "cloud" and the decentralized internet.
- the internet has evolved to be about the cloud, its invisible and sophisticated. Question how that makes it sinister. Information is diffused and not concrete.

Truth and science are even suspicious now. 

Hans Haack - foundation for institutional critique
Tania Bruc--- cuban artist who questions power in relation to the cuban government.
Forensic Architecture - watch the Whitney biennale video from 2019

Anthony Discenza - we looked at the truth is
- my art might not take the form of a specific medium, or physical sculpture even. Consider how you can create installations or **spaces for institutional critique**. 
- the truth is was explored in many forms. is an ever evolving work that can be displayed in many different ways.

Looked at the sculpture with the white plinth in the middle of the room
- institutional critique of sculpture, who says what is and isn't sculpture. 
- sculpture as a metaphysical concept.
- "variable media work"
- I brought up how the work critiques the idea of accessibility, the first description is something that people can see and understand conceptually, but the second sculpture is just an account of "what you should think about the sculpture" as though you're looking at it with your eyes. It's funny as an institutional critique because it pokes fun at the way we perceive and write about sculpture when we use our eyes, but is sculpture always seen?
- work critiques power - through institutional critique.

In terms of sculptors that work in the realm of tech, look at **pioneer works**.
