Welcome to my Digital Garden
```

Hello, my name is Kenna and I'm a student at the University of Cincinnati studying to receive my Bachelors of Fine Arts. I also received my Associates of Applied Business, in Applied Graphic Communications at the University of Cincinnati Blue Ash.

This is my [[Digital Garden]], where I engage in [[Learning in Public]].

I am currently exploring:
- [[Post Internet Art]]
- [[3D Printing]]
