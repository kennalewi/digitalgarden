 # What Is Post Internet Art?

To the uninitiated, Post Internet art might seem like art "after the internet", which isn't inherently true. Like post-modernists, adapted and expanded on modernism, Post Internet Artists are using the internet to comment on complex issues and ideas.

> Of course, both Cortright and Rafman also produce real-world artworks, objects that can be hung on the wall or placed on a plinth in a gallery; the most counterintuitive aspect of the post-Internet label is that it extends to work in the traditional formats of painting and sculpture. In fact, one of the features that distinguishes post-Interent art from the "Net Art" of the late '90s and early 2000s is its ability to crossover between online and offline formats. While Net Art refers to art that uses the Internet as its medium and cannot be experienced any other way, post-Internet art makes the leap from the screen into brick-and-mortar galleries.

# Where Post Internet Art belongs
From Anthony Antonellis' writing, ["Internet art in a gallery"](https://www.anthonyantonellis.com/writing/internet-art-in-a-gallery). 
![[Pasted image 20240519130812.png]] 
Antonellis argues that Internet Art should be viewed in a [[holodeck]], or it's natural habitat, browser tabs and windows. Browser tabs are like framed paintings. Viewing internet artwork at home situates you into a relationship with the artist, as they have probably sat in the same position as you creating the work. Internet artwork in a gallery "adapts the work at the expense of this intimacy". Gallery presents a unique chance to do something different with the work.

Final consensus here:
- Taking online work and presenting it with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse doesn't cut it.
- Don't seek to make a simple documentation of what already exists online.
- Internet art can "manifest and be articulated in site specific ways".
