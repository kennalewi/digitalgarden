I've been exploring ideas about how to use 3D printing as a Studio Artist. At first, I thought this medium might be hard to defend in an artistic sense, considering I have lots of internal conflict about my design practice versus my practice as an artist. I've had lots of people ask me about "wether I'm a designer or an artist", and I find that question hard to answer, because I'm both. Anyways, I'm exploring 3D printing deeper as a medium and understanding how I can use it to create [[Speculative Objects]].
