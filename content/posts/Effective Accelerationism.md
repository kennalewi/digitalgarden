# Intro
Philosophical group started by Gui Vernieri, a former Google Quantum Computing engineer. 
- Promoted these ideas as Bas Von Vering on Twitter as **BasedBeffJezos**

Not just an abstract philosophy but aims to have practical influence in the tech industry and beyond, encouraging a proactive approach to shaping the future through technological innovation.
## Main Points
- **Optimism about Technology**: The movement views technology as the solution to many of humanity’s problems and believes that technological innovation should be encouraged and accelerated.
- **Deregulation**: Effective accelerationists argue that to achieve rapid technological progress, there should be minimal regulatory barriers. They believe that deregulation will allow technology to develop and be implemented faster.
- **Hyperstition Awareness**: The movement is aware of the concept of hyperstition—the idea that fictional narratives can shape reality. Effective accelerationists actively use this concept to manifest a desired future by promoting and spreading narratives that support technological advancement.
- **Combating Doomerism**: Effective accelerationism opposes the pessimistic view that progress is stagnating or that the future is bleak. Instead, it promotes a positive outlook on the potential of technology to create a better future.
