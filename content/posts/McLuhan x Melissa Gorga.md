Marshall McLuhan's thesis about privacy in the digital age, but turned into a shitty pop song, very vague in it's actual wording, not saying much aside from being on display. 

Something similar to the real housewives song "On Display", that Melissa Gorga wrote. I like how she took the idea of being on display "each and every day" and made a kitschy, uncritical song about how it "effects her". The funny part of this is how she literally signed up to be a Real Housewife, and gets a royalty check for airing her family's lives.

I think it's comedic and funny to relate it to our daily experiences of being on display without even our real consent. Sure we signed up for social media, but not under the pretense of being watched and sacrificing all semblance of privacy to fuel our addiction for entertainment and supposed human connection. 

Despite Melissa "penning" this song to make a vapid, pop, catchy bop basically kind of bragging about how she's the center of attention (at least in terms of TMZ..), it is weirdly kind of profound, and every time the surveillance state comes up in conversation her prophetic words are always ringing in the back of my mind.
