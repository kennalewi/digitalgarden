Looking at buying filament to match a specific aesthetic of tech products from the 2000s, a time when our idea of futuristic is "the matrix".

I'm also thinking about what tech products would look like in the future. In a world where we use plastic, bioplastic, different metals, it looks like the above. But what happens if we find a better material, something that we havent considered before.
What if we could grow material, what if we made it out of plants

What Materials do Tech products use:

## Materials of the dematerialized: are there raw material supply risks for companies in the digital sector ?
the digital sector is becoming increasingly resource-hungry

raw materials such as copper, gold and lithium, digital technologies also rely on much lesser-known metals such as indium, tantalum and gallium to manufacture the equipment that enables it to exist (computers and smartphones, but also transmission networks and data centers).

# Tech of the future
- energy generation via plant life
	- what if we generated energy through the mycellium network and used it to generate unique data that became currency
