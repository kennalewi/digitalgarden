# My Presentation
## [[Jill Magid]]

“My artwork is often about engaging systems of government power, more recently corporations...” (Magid 0:17-0:24).

Evidence Locker 

- explores surveillance and intimacy through Liverpool’s extensive CCTV system
- initiated the project by writing daily subject access requests to the Liverpool Police Department, asking them to track her.
- Over 31 days, collected and edited this footage into a series of videos, 
- Created a book that presented her subject access requests as a novella, critiquing and repurposing a system designed for control into a medium for personal expression and artistic exploration.

Created a book of her correspondences
“This book is a collection of my subject access requests forms that reads as a love story and a novella through the CCTV cameras” (Magid 2:22-2:28).

“Liverpool citywide CCTV system, one of the largest of its kind, holds footage for 31 days before that footage cascades off the system unless the police department puts it in an evidence locker or a citizen writes a subject access request form” (Magid 1:27-1:42).

“I filled it out like a letter to a lover and sent them in with the address of ‘dear observer’” (Magid 2:11-2:16).

“The videos I made move from a Big Brother distant point of view to one of intense intimacy” (Magid 3:31-3:34).
