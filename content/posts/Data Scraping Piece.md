# Intro
Created a piece where I scraped news headlines and bylines, distilled them, and then fed them into Suno AI to make a song
- Created a script that pulls key words from a Google News Page search query
	- Bookmark of links to tutorials I used
		- [Web Scrape Google News with Python Requests and Beautiful Soup | Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikf6Xdox0Go)
		- [Coding Web Crawler in Python with Scrapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_3gjHGxIJc)
		- Generating Proxies.. shouldnt need this for scraping google, but just in case: [Rotating Proxies For Web Requests in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbtCl9jJyyc)
- Gathered text
- Pasted it into Suno.AI with "Pop song about:" at the beginning
- Got a crazy song.

# Response
## Interdisciplinary Studio
- How can you push this deeper
	- Keep feeding data over and over, make it more and more strange
- Make a music video from your "livestream" of you making the video
- Connection with Fluxus - this piece is like modern fluxus in a way
- Treat this AI as a medium and keep melding and experimenting with it.
- Read: [[Wild Blue Media]]
# Next Steps
- Maybe I can scrape FOX/CNN and other media sites for their top stories and create songs using that data as well. Might be interesting.
