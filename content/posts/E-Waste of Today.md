I've been thinking a lot about [[Speculation]], and as a result, some things that are so ubiquitous today that we could have never really suspected in the past. 

# Ecig waste

I remember when I was younger and I would have to step over cigarette butts on the street. They were everywhere, and despite there being disposable containers for cigarettes, 


Speculative fiction:
What would we use after getting rid of e-cigs. 
- we like the idea of nicotine packets like zyn, because they are seen as the "most" safe option. We thought vapes were safer than cigs, but they're still dangerous, and as we're being woken up to that reality, we're now thinking about alternatives to vaping as well. 
- I feel like I've seen a rise in intravenous interventions for health in daily life. People have used patches for a long time, but one thing that's been interesting is seeing the increase in people using glucose monitors.
	- this is actually supported by data
- This kind of parallels the new need to track every metric of our body in a discrete way. We've made smart watches that collect data about our heart rate, rings, anything you can think of. This is all in the pursuit of living "healthier lives", but are there really massive returns on this excessive level of monitoring for otherwise healthy people?
- The world's most measured man, Bryan Johnson exists, and is heralded as an example of how we can lengthen our lives through interventions of technology and health.

I could see us using an intravenous method of dispensing nicotine in the future.
