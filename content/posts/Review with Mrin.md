Reviewed writing and plan for [[Interdisciplinary Research Presentation]] with Mrin. This relates to my [[Artist Presentation]]. I'll also use this to develop my [[Thesis Proposal]]

Writing down notes here for what we talked about and what else to check out. 

- Artist's statement needs to evolve past just the cloud considering even just talking today we've found deeper meaning and backing to my work
- Research Materials are good
	- Look into research surrounding Speculative Design and Critical Social Design.
	- Guy Dubord - society of the spectacle
		- situationists, subverting control from government authority by going on derives, or walks without destination, doing strange things in public, using public areas for unintended uses. 
		- emphasis on **misuse** - artists misuse all the time as a central aspect of their work.
	- Production of space
- Artist Influences - 
	- Look into [[American Artist]]'s work - specifically the practice of creating speculative objects following the ideas proposed in Octavia Butler's work
- Themes - 
	- Race and Sociopolitical Perspective - it's good to cover this and will enhance my work, that way I'm not just covering the white female perspective. Work can be boring if it only covers your perspective for fear of talking "out of place". [[Hito Steyerl]] is a great reference for the race and socioeconomic perspective of AI bias. 

Presentation should cover the idea of Speculation as a central part of my practice.
- Look into etymology - something that confused me is, is a spectacle the same thing as speculation, or speculative?
- In a fucked up world, it's great that we can still speculate, we can still dream up our own futures, and explore them. 

**Tech is not utopian, it retains bias, and much of the discourse coming from "tech bros" pioneering AI and tech refuses to be critical of AI's bias.**
