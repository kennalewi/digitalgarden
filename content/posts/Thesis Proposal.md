I am writing this thesis proposal as an assignment for class.

---

1. **_The artist essay and the Plan of Study_** 
	- combined into a 4–5-page document
	- _The artist essay_ 
		- 3-page text that indicates the themes, approach, media involved, and research that supports your practice in your thesis. 
	- _The plan of study_ 
		- more list oriented and will include specifics about how you keep your art moving ahead in the off semesters. Include books to read, skills to hone, exhibitions to view, studio access strategies, etc. 
		- must show a month-by-month study/research/studio plan.
2. ***Proposal statement***
	- Based on your responses in the **Work Forecast**, the artwork made in the weeks that follow, and critical discourse about your work
	- generate a **_proposal statement_** that will link the work created this semester with pertinent research topics to be pursued over the next calendar year.
	- This proposal will also serve as a ‘seed document’ for your Written Thesis to be written NEXT SPRING (This fall for me) Semester. 
	- In this document, you will:
		- state a point of view about your subject and begin to list how you will defend it. 
		- The document will include both a thesis sentence for the paper you will write next semester and a description of the artwork you will complete over the next year.
3. **_bibliography_**
	- 3-5 scholarly articles that relate to your practice and thesis statement 
	- 3 artists that relate to your work.

MLA formatting

Optional materials:
- Images of work from influences or Images of your own work
	- Both of these must be explained and written about in your proposal, do not include images just to fill out pages and without writing about them. Have all images at the end of the paper (before or after the bibliography), numbered as Image 1, *author, title, year, technique*, and refer to them in the body of your proposal. For example: “Image 1 is a work by …. In this work, the artist…. I picked this work because…” or any variation of this, in your own words.

# Intro
I've been writing lots, and starting to make some new work this semester. I'm going to have to amp up the creation of new work considering I am being required to grow in my practice at a rapid pace. My philosophy going into this next phase is to sit with readings + watching videos/lectures, and take simple notes. Then, for anything that I read or write about, I have to make at least *something* in the form of an actual artwork, share it with others, and record feedback and further observations.

There's a huge repository of things I've written here to help me hone in on topics. Kind of a continuation of [[a body of work for thesis]].
## Blueprint
### Thesis/Main Concepts
#### The Cloud
- [[Conceptual Piece about the Cloud]]
	- [[Conceptual Cloud Piece - Reflection]]
#### [[Hyperstition]]
- is "On Display" by Melissa Gorga a hyperstition?? [[McLuhan x Melissa Gorga]]
### Secondary Concepts
- Caroline brought up some topics that I should look into when we had our [[DAAPFE chat with Caroline|DAAPFE chat]]
	- The power of designers, they decide the visual language of **Proper Nouns**. Which [[David Rudnick]] talked about in his "Crisis of Graphic Practices" talk. 

### My Writings/Works
- [[Anthony Antonellis' Net Art Implant]] - memes attached at the bottom
- [[Conceptual Piece about the Cloud]] - finished video piece
- [[Data Scraping Piece]] - somewhat finished video/multimedia piece about 
#### Ideas
- [[McLuhan x Melissa Gorga]] - funny thought about Melissa Gorga's music and it's unintentional deepness.
- [[Personal Hyperstitions]] - writing about hyperstitions and creating my own
### Medium
#### Video Art
- Narrative/Non-narrative videos
#### Installation
- Thinking about using PVC and 3D printing, experimentation stage at this point, how can I use it to create installations
- Old tech devices like monitors
### Art Movement
#### [[Post Internet Art]]
- Theories about Post Internet Art like [[Artie Vierkant]] - "The Image Object Post-Internet"
- [[Anthony Antonellis]] -  ["Internet art in a gallery"](https://www.anthonyantonellis.com/writing/internet-art-in-a-gallery) is an argument against Internet art in the white cube, argues essentially that it is best experienced through the same lens by which it was created, sitting in front of a monitor. I wouldn't say that I agree, but it is interesting to consider his perspective. 
	- I wonder if this perspective is too motivated by current society needing to see themselves in the art in order to be affected by it?
	- I'd argue that some Post Internet Art is better seen in massive scale in a gallery space than simply on a laptop or phone.
	- Antonellis really argues that *if* you're going to put Post Internet Art in a gallery, it shouldn't take the form of documenting what is easily seen online but transforming it.
- [[Brad Troemel]] - The Post Internet Report, is a good overview of the movement, but mostly supplementary information + opinions/analysis.
### Bibliography
- [[The Stack On Software and Sovereignty]] - long lengthy book about the cloud, could be very good primary research for my art. Will definitely be reading some reviews/outlines first.
