# Intro
While creating a [[Digital Garden]] is great and all, there are many different interpretations and versions of a Digital Garden out there. I've found that resources and guiding principles surrounding this practice are scattered and varied. Because of this, it's become necessary for me to create my own manifesto, or philosophy!

# Kenna's Digital Garden Manifesto
## 1.  [**Learn in public**](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public)

The central aspect of learning in public is to take learning exhaust and convert it into public thought. make the thing you wish you had found when learning, active sharing of learning process. reach out to people who are also sharing online.

## 2. **Make it scrappy**
speed over perfection. make your thoughts and make them fast. 

2. [**Own your Data**](https://indieweb.org) - post everything on your personal site, but you can promote it on social media channels like youtube, discord, twitter, etc.

4. [Make what you need, use what you make](https://indieweb.org/use_what_you_make)
