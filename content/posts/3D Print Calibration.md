Working on calibrating further with my Bambu A1 Mini. I've switched out to the .2 nozzle, printing on .06mm height and it looks so seamless, really really great prints. 

I started a [random totodile print from yeggi](https://www.yeggi.com/q/pokemon/2/), looking at optimizing this figurine and getting more detail.

Noticed that the calibration time is extremely long. This happened with the previous print as well.

Can take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes to calibrate before making a print. I'm wondering if there's a way to calibrate material so it doesn't have to do this each time. 

I could probably do this through the Calibration settings in the Bambu Studio App, but there's some more information on [this forum post](https://forum.bambulab.com/t/calibrating-extrusion-taking-along-time-at-start-or-prints/46068/5). Gimbal says that the Orca slicers default pressure advance values are probably the same as Bambu's, which skips calibration. 

Either way, the prints are looking amazing(ly small)!
