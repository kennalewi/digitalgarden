I'm working on making a [[Conceptual Art|conceptual art]] piece related to the ideas I've explored in [[the cloud and decentralized internet]].
# The cloud is:
## Metaphysical
The cloud exists as a construct of large amounts of data stored in data centers on various hard drives and servers.

Despite the material systems that it exists on, it's not something that we can "hold" with our hands. In the sense of ordinary people, without extensive understanding of technology, the cloud is intangible. 

In the same way, it reminds me of holding a human brain (I've held a brain before but I really don't remember wether it was a human one or an animal one). Holding a human brain suggests the fact that it once held thoughts, emotions, and cognitive processes of an entire person's life in every aspect. It implies the existence of a person, but alone it isn't a human. In the same way, I describe these data centers as a kind of "brain" for the internet. The existence of the cloud relies upon these functioning data centers. 
## Nebulous
The cloud is difficult to comprehend, it is a very abstract idea which is sort of implied by the fact that the best word we have to describe it is a "cloud". You would think we'd have a word that implies something solid if it were so easy to understand. 
## Omniscient
The cloud is omniscient in the sense that it exists everywhere with an internet connection. Considering many people have access to the internet, either through public wifi or home routers, it is present in all of our lives. 
## Sinister
The cloud knows way too much about us, and because it isn't a person with emotions or feelings, there's no "negotiating". If the cloud gained sentience, I'd imagine many people could be doomed. 

This brings to mind the idea of [[Roko's Basilisk]], a thought experiment about sentient AI and its implications on individuals. 

```
The cloud is all of us? All that we ever were?
