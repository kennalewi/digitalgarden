Made this note to explore art with ideas that talk about the "living" object. 

- What qualities make something "alive"?
- Is there a [[Speculative Objects|speculative future]] we can consider where a paradigm shift occurs, and [[AI]] is considered alive via [[AI Sentience]]?

Artist [[Theo Jansen]] is exploring this through his creations dating back to 1990, called ''Strandbeests".
