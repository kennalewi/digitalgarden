Comprehensive, interconnected system of digital infrastructure that operates on a global scale. This concept encompasses various layers of technology and communication networks that enable extensive computational capabilities across the planet. Key aspects include:
- **Infrastructure Layers**: The system integrates diverse elements such as cloud computing services, data centers, undersea cables, satellites, and other networked devices. These components form the physical and virtual foundation for planetary-scale computation.
- **Interconnected Systems**: It emphasizes the interconnected nature of these systems, where data flows seamlessly across different regions and platforms, allowing for real-time processing, storage, and analysis.
- **Global Impact**: Planetary Scale Computation impacts numerous domains, including economics, politics, environment, and society. It influences how information is disseminated, how decisions are made, and how global challenges are addressed.
- **Scalability and Complexity**: The concept highlights the scalability and complexity of computational processes that can handle vast amounts of data, perform intricate calculations, and support advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.
- **Governance and Ethics**: Bratton also addresses the governance and ethical considerations of such a pervasive computational system, stressing the need for policies and regulations that ensure equitable access, security, and responsible use of technology.
