I was introduced to this artist by my professor, and his work is endlessly interesting. His work relates to [[Post Internet Art]] in that his work comments on beliefs, conventions, and exists as an [[examination of power]]. 

## A Sculpture (Reclining Figure)

This piece is beautiful... no really it is. I think it's a wonderful example of [[institutional critique]], and [[examination of power]]. 

Mrin showed me this work and had me respond to it after listening to the first two excerpts. What does it say?
I said that what interested me was the [[examination of power]], one thing that stuck out to me was the fact that the first description gave a full explanation of the work in its physical sense. The piece was fully described so that someone who is non-sighted could imagine the work and create it in their mind. The second description was very "academic". The words used to describe the work mostly spoke to what we should think about it, that "the sculpture has an undeniably powerful presence". It made me think about what power the words hold and to who. Someone who is not sighted most likely could not imagine the sculpture in front of them based on the second description. 

Deeper than that, the piece utilizes [[institutional critique]] to talk about what sculpture is, and [[where power lies]]. There is no physical sculpture there, some would scoff and say "that isn't art", but their opinion isn't the only opinion that exists, nor is it the inherent truth. It's funny as an institutional critique because it pokes fun at the way we perceive and write about sculpture when we use our eyes, but is sculpture always seen?

The truth is.. that sculpture does not have to be physical. This calls back to the ideas of [[Marcel Duchamp]], and his work "Fountain", as well as (insert artist). The work is a piece of [[Conceptual Art]] that comments on [[the metaphysical]], and its legitimacy despite being outside of our physical perception.

## The Truth as We Know It (#thetruth)

Speaking of the truth, this piece is also very impactful. It is a [[variable media work]] that took utterances of "the truth is that" on the internet, along with the rest of the statement, organized them in alphabetical order, and was presented in many ways. 

The work is not part of a specific medium, so it exists in [[the metaphysical]], and manifests in ways we can see or experience. In the form I'm encountering the work, it is an audio file, which consists of narrators reading the writing from each artist. 

It also exists as a [[living and continually evolving project]], considering the collection can be revised and updated.
