From [[Brad Troemel]], cycled by which certain media can incite reactions from different groups of people. This is shown through the use of [[The Political Compass]] where the discourse surrounding said media is promoted or revolted against through a predictable set of channels. Keep in mind, nobody is immune, and while these two paths are confined to "Liberal vs. Conservative", you could likely make similar paths for any controversy using whichever Political Ideology model you subscribe to.
