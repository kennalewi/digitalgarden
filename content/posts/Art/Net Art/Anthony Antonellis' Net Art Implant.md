I found this project extremely interesting, and something to think about in terms of [[Post Internet Art]]. Anthony Antonellis created this implant that goes into his skin and has a simple gif that can be transfered to anyone via [[NFC technology]].

# Interesting Points from NFC Article
## Longevity
You might wonder, what happens when the thing dies and it's in his body?
Answer: actually you don't have to worry about that, because NFC chips don't require power. They are powered by a magnetic field generated by the reader's device.
## Oooo Scary!
Watching the video of him getting the chip implanted made head spin. Specifically, the part where the MASSIVE fucking needle *popped* through his skin. 🤢

Anthony actually had nightmares (wonder why!) after getting the implant, despite the healing process going well.

> [!quote] [Source](Artist With RFID Net Art Implant in His Hand Feels Great, Thanks Haters!)
> “The most disturbing part was the series of bizarre dreams I had about the implant rejecting. In one, I dreamt the implant bounced around and loosened the skin on my hand until it became baggy like a wet leather glove. Later, I dreamt the implant migrated its way up my index finger and popped out through my fingernail. In reality the chip hasn’t moved a millimeter from where it was inserted. After about a week the swelling went away and it was healed save for a small scab. I thought the chip would feel hard like a Tic Tac, but since its below the skin in the subcutaneous tissue it’s very padded and feels not unlike a tendon.”

> He adds, “The subconscious is like Fox News: It’s paranoid and makes up its own facts.”

## Public Reaction
Anthony documented his "haters" on his tumblr blog ["But I feel great!"](https://butifeelgreat.tumblr.com). Some of these responses are so visceral and reactive.

## Questions relating to the piece.
- What does this piece say about ownership? Is this the only piece of technology that you can fully own? Or, is it just a cheap imitation of a USB but more deep literally and metaphorically. 
- What could this technology be considered? A tattoo? Will tons of people have this in the future?
- Can you become a hacker simply by waving your hand in front of things or holding someone's credit card?
# the NFC chip
More information about the NFC chip that I believe he had implanted can be found [here](https://dangerousthings.com/product/xnt/) - as well as an FAQ, and an [post](https://forum.dangerousthings.com/t/x-series-implantable-transponder-faq/28#faq-rfid-vs-nfc) I found interesting.

## Barcode Tattoos
The modern barcode system originated in 1940's, and began to see commercial use in 1975. [(source)](https://www.tattoodo.com/articles/5-reasons-why-barcode-tattoos-arent-such-a-great-idea-4815) Barcodes have an association with products, capitalism, consumerism and labor.

Apparently Barcode Tattoos signify a "rejection of consumer culture", or "warnings against becoming a product or 'slave'." This seems kind of pseudo-intellectualism to me, considering the inherent irony of using a barcode to label yourself as a product. While many of these tattoos are deconstructed, they're still.. you know.. a barcode. At this point, it's kind of like a foray into [[Mini Brands]] and [[21st Century Consumerism]]. 

The article I've referenced here also talks about how it's an "ironic symbol, giving a head nod to the disposable condition of the modern worker, and the aspiration for something better to replace the current system."

Or maybe it's just a barcode?? This concept is breaking my brain. I feel like the barcode tattoo is a symbol of [[Millennial Culture]] in 2012-2016ish era online. The era when Rupi Kaur was profound reading, everyone's Macbook Pro background was Banksy's "Girl with Balloon".. Millennial Culture during this time was full of these "profound" statements that were in reality pretty on the nose.

## QR Code tattoo
This tattoo is a bit more utilitarian than philosophical. 

This writer talks about how she got the tattoo to link to a password protected website with valuable medical information including full medical history, medication records, allergies, emergency contact, primary care MD info, insurance info, and an Advance Directive.

The person who got this tattoo, Casey Quinlan, talks about patient activism. And got the tattoo out of frustration with the medical system in general after navigating cancer treatment.

> Why did I do this? Because I’ve been waiting for the medical-industrial complex to deliver on their promise of health information exchange (HIE), the promise that they’ve been making for years, but have yet to fork over.

> [!quote] [QRs, DNRs, and tattoos — oh my!](https://medium.com/tincture/qrs-dnrs-and-tattoos-oh-my-dcaf4685db8b)
> My tattoo is 90% political statement

From my perspective, knowing a little bit about websites, and hacking, I worry that simply password protecting a website isn't enough to keep hackers from obtaining your full medical history. While it might not be that valuable in comparison to user databases that constantly come under attack. 
### Coronavirus Pass Tattoo
When scanned shows coronavirus Green Pass - Italian equivalent of a Covid vaccination card.

Some notes:
- **[Size and pixel resolution requirements for it to be read.](https://www.barcodeart.com/store/customizable/qr_tattoos/QR_Code_Tattoo_Guide.html)** 
- Is getting important information put on a QR code safe? Is it useful, or "doomsday prepper" adjacent?
- I do think the idea of [[Preparing an Advance Directive form]], and owning your medical information for you to provide to medical professionals are a great idea. Especially for those who have a chronic condition like diabetes, serious allergies, etc.

## Spotify code tattoo
If Barcode tattoos were a foray into [[21st Century Consumerism]], Spotify code tattoos are like the proverbial kool-aid man crashing through the wall.. 

Music has long been a way to connect to others, signal your personal beliefs, etc. While people used to get lyrics, logos, or images from a band, album, or song tattooed on their body, now there's an even more interactive way. Streaming services like Spotify now have their own marketing ploys to get people to use their products.
Spotify launched its proprietary codes in 2017, which opened the floodgates for people to get their favorite songs tattooed. 

Some notes: [(source)](https://abc7news.com/what-is-a-spotify-tattoo-song-code-qr/14378086/)
- **You have to use the Spotify app to scan the code and use it.** This isn't really a problem nowadays because Spotify seems to be the most popular music streaming service (at least among my college aged peers)
- **They can fade and be unusable.** Some people get them in places that aren't flat, or in places that ink fades from easily like hands. Either way, they're not always scannable after tattooing, and they will eventually not work anymore even if Spotify still has the feature. 
- **You *can* use the code scanning feature without having premium for now.** Spotify used to be completely free at one point I believe, and just like Netflix, I have no hope that they will keep every feature that's free on launch free forever. You can generate codes at [spotifycodes.com](https://spotifycodes.com).
