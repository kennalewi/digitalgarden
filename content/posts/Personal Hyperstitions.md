I've been thinking a lot about [[Hyperstition|Hyperstitions]], and what kinds of hypersitions I could write or come up with.

1. Birds aren't real
	- This concept already exists, but mostly focuses on the idea of birds being robots who spy on us, and that all birds were killed in the 80's. I don't think that birds really are all fake, but I wonder if with the invention of even smaller cameras and microchips, and even Elon Musk's neurallink, could the CIA/FBI program birds to spy? Could they plant cameras in them and collect information about individuals?
