- Cited in my [[Artist Presentation]], Talks about how we act out when we're being watched and know that we're being watched
	- 25:25 - ...if the panopticon effect is when you don't know you are being watched or not and so behave as if you are then the inverse panopticon effect is when you know you're being watched but act as if you aren't. This is today's surveillance culture exhibitionism in bad faith. The emergence of stack platforms doesn't promise any solution or even distinctions between friend and enemy..
	- This relates to what Jann Choy said in her Ted Talk that I went over at [[Speculation]]

Key Arguments about [[Planetary Scale Computation]]
