> A speculative object refers to a concept or artifact that is created primarily for the purpose of exploring ideas, imagining future scenarios, or questioning current perspectives. These objects are often used in the fields of design, art, and technology to provoke thought, stimulate debate, or explore the potential impacts and implications of societal trends, new technologies, or hypothetical situations.

> Speculative objects are not intended for practical functionality but serve as tools for reflection and discussion. They are frequently found in speculative design practices where designers create tangible representations of abstract concepts to challenge conventional thinking and encourage a deeper understanding of how choices made today might influence the future. These objects often embody theoretical or critical questions about possible futures, ethics, and the role of technology in our lives.
