### Medium Rework
In relation to [[Post-Conceptual Cloud Piece]]:
Consider your medium more closely, read [[The Medium is the Message]]
 - tech corporate speak - use the graphic design structures I've been trained in
 - broaden approach from something hyperspecific like jenna's work to complete distractions.
 - don't feel the need to teach - try to make a video with no obvious signs - make a cloud without making a symbol
 - experiment with:
	 - touchdesigner
	 - [Suno AI](https://suno.com)
	 - processing code
