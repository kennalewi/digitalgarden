I got a 3D printer recently and have been saving lots of projects. I'm mostly experimenting right now, considering you can make almost anything with a 3D printer, I'm only a few steps into a giant ocean of potential.

Because this has the potential to become a quite expensive hobby, I'm considering wether it would be advantageous for me to [[Selling 3D Printed Products|sell my prints online]].
