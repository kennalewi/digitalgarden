> I am not really a programmer. The first time I took a class in "computer science" was at a summer school when I was 8 or 9 years old and I remember crying and switching to the "storytelling" class. Years later in college I still didn't like computer science and got below 50% on most of my exams. I have since grown used to programming only because it is the mechanism that seems to make most of the world move. Believe me, if I could order Pizzas dominos has a great online delivery mechanism, by painting, I definitely would paint.

In this article, there's a general overview of Cory. What really impressed me was his Whitney appearance.

Arcangel is celebrated for his modifications of popular video games, a series of which were on view in that show; he also reuses appropriated gradient patterns from Photoshop, YouTube videos, and other bits of digital pop culture to craft prints, drawings, musical compositions, videos, and performance works.

# Appropriation and Game Modifications
## [Super Mario Clouds](https://coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/2002-001-super-mario-clouds)
In this piece, Cory Modified a game cartridge of Super Mario Bros. for the NES so that all of the game data is deleted, except for the clouds. The result is a kind of digital painting, a blue sky with clouds moving across the X axis. More information about this piece can be found [here](https://conifer.rhizome.org/cory_arcangel/super-mario-clouds/list/2002-/b1/20021118090831/http://www.beigerecords.com/cory/21c/21c.html), it's actually quite funny because despite creating one of the most seminal pieces of Post Internet Art history, he is very self effacing in this writeup.

# Additional Notes
I think the medium explanations that Cory uses are very interesting, because he doesn't overcomplicate things. It genuinely is a Modded Super Mario Bros. cartridge.
