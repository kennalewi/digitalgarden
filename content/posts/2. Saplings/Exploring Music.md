# Intro
In my sound studio, I was shown this website called everynoise.com. I had seen it before (sorry had to flex) but was so excited to remember this site. 

Basically its a huge data aggregation project where these people sorted through algorithms and made a whole database of music based mostly on genre, but you can also sort/explore in other ways like by artist. 

You click a genre - and then click an artist and listen. Pretty neat.

Anyways, just wanted to note down any notable artists I've discovered
# Music I Found
## Intelligent Dance Music / Ambient / Electronic
I've listened to some artists here, I also recognized some I didn't realize were considered to be part of this genre. 
1. Aphex Twin
	- Starting to really explore him and his discography more. I've always found his work to be pretty interesting, at least as something to experience in the background.
	- **Selected Ambient Works 85-92** is my first real listen so far.
2. Four Tet
	- Marimbaaaaaaaaaa... Rip Steve Jobs you would have loved iphone ringtone-core music
	- *Loved* is a great listen, the first one I heard. 
	- Looks like his newest releases include some stuff with Skrillex (massive Skrillex head over here, at least original dubstep stuff) 
		- *Volver* is pretty good
		- *Baby again...* with Fred again.. and Skrillex is one I've heard and wasn't obsessed with per say. 
		- *Butterflies* is kinda fire this is going in a playlist for sure.
3.  

## Highlife Jazz
I learned about this style of jazz recently, it's pretty nice! I think they use it in the a24 film "high life" as well.
