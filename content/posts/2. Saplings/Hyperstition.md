# Introduction
- Portmanteau of Hype + Superstition.
- Fictional ideas that become reality by replicating themselves through pop culture and media

> [!quote] Title
> Superstitions are merely false beliefs, but _hyperstitions_ – by their very existence as ideas – function causally to bring about their own reality.

> [!quote] [Cyborg Anthro Wiki](http://cyborganthropology.com/Hyperstition)
> Hyperstition is a term used to describe self-fulfilling prophecies that come true through their existence and spread. It is associated with science fiction, speculative fiction, futurism, occultism, and conspiracy theories.
