I am continuing to work on a body of work for my thesis during my BFA. I've talked extensively with my professor about it over the past few days, and am documenting it here for future reference.

I initially thought I should focus on the idea of [[The Panopticon]] in relation to [[Post Internet Art]]. Mrin noted that maybe there's a better lens to explore the internet through than panopticon because in this new age of the internet, we may all be viewed by "owners of power" like Instagram, Facebook, etc. but we cannot see them and what they know about us. 

Mrin suggested that I explore [[the cloud and decentralized internet]]. 

I presented the idea of the panopticon and the post internet
- in a way, panopticon might not be the best analogy because we cannot see who's in the middle
- look into exploring the "cloud" and the decentralized internet.
- the internet has evolved to be about the cloud, its invisible and sophisticated. Question how that makes it sinister. Information is diffused and not concrete.

Truth and science are even suspicious now. 

Hans Haack - foundation for institutional critique
Tania Bruc--- cuban artist who questions power in relation to the cuban government.
Forensic Architecture - watch the Whitney biennale video from 2019


When looking at [[Anthony Discenza]]'s work, Mrin told me that when I'm creating my work, I should focus more on creating a space for [[institutional critique]], as opposed to making artworks that "tell people what to think". (Not to downplay painting or image/object making, it's just not what my subject matter necessitates. Also, these objects can be speculative).


my art might not take the form of a specific medium, or physical sculpture even. Consider how you can create installations or **spaces for institutional critique**. 

I'm considering what it means to create [[Speculative Objects]]. I haven't researched what they are fully, and what they can be in my practice. I've heard of art taking the form of an [[Art Objects|Art Object]], Will have to research that more as well (because I'm not so sure what the difference is haha).

Working on a piece, the working idea is a [[Conceptual Piece about the Cloud]].
