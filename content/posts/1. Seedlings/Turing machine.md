> A Turing machine is a theoretical computing machine invented by Alan Turing in 1936, which is used as a model of general computation. The machine is quite simple but powerful enough to simulate any computer algorithm. Here’s how it works:
> 
> 1. **Tape**: The Turing machine uses an infinite strip of tape as its memory. This tape is divided into cells, each of which can hold a single symbol from a finite set.
> 2. **Read/Write Head**: The machine has a head that can read and write symbols on the tape and move the tape left or right one cell at a time.
> 3. **State Register**: The machine has a state register that stores the state of the Turing machine. The number of states is finite, and there is one special start state.
> 4. **Transition Function**: This is a set of rules that, based on the current state and the symbol it reads on the tape, tells the machine what symbol to write, how to move the tape (left or right), and what the next state should be.

> The Turing machine is a fundamental model in the theory of computation and computer science. It has been used to demonstrate what computers can theoretically compute, referred to as Turing-completeness. Despite its simplicity, the Turing machine can simulate the logic of any computer algorithm, and it’s often used to prove various capabilities and limitations of computational systems.
