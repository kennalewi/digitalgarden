## Key Points
- **Formation**: The CCRU was informally established around 1995 by faculty members and students at the University of Warwick’s philosophy department.
- **Key Figures**:
	- Nick Land - philosopher
	- Sadie Plant - cultural theorist
	- Mark Fisher (also known as k-punk)

### Main Philosophies
- **Cybernetics and Culture**: The CCRU explored the intersections between cybernetics (the study of systems, control, and communication) and cultural theory, often emphasizing the feedback loops between technology and society.
- **[[Effective Accelerationism|Accelerationism]]**: One of the CCRU’s key contributions was the development of accelerationist thought, which advocates for the acceleration of capitalist processes as a means to bring about radical social change.
- **[[Hyperstition]]**: The CCRU introduced the concept of “hyperstition,” which refers to ideas that, through their circulation and belief, become reality.

### Works and Cultural Influence

- **Online Presence**: maintained an online presence through their website and other digital platforms, where they shared their writings and engaged with a broader audience. Some of these texts have been archived and can still be found online, contributing to the group’s enduring influence.
- **Publications**: The CCRU produced a variety of writings, often blending dense theoretical discourse with elements of science fiction and speculative philosophy. These works were disseminated through various unconventional means, including zines, online forums, and limited-edition booklets.
	- “Abstract Culture” - zine series featuring contributions from various members. The content was highly experimental, combining elements of cybernetics, philosophy, and cultural theory.
	- “Virtual Futures: Cyberotics, Technology and Post-Human Pragmatics” (1996) - Edited by Joan Broadhurst Dixon and Eric J. Cassidy, includes contributions from CCRU members and associates, exploring themes of cybernetics and post-humanism.
	- “Fanged Noumena: Collected Writings 1987–2007” by Nick Land - Although published later, this collection gathers many of Nick Land’s writings, including those produced during his time with the CCRU. The book is a key resource for understanding the group’s intellectual output.
	- “A Thousand Plateaus: Schizoculture” - Although not an original CCRU publication, the group’s work was heavily influenced by Deleuze and Guattari’s “A Thousand Plateaus.” CCRU members often referenced and built upon the concepts from this text in their own work.
	- “[[CCRU Writings 1997–2003]]” - This collection compiles various texts produced by the CCRU, showcasing their unique blend of philosophy, fiction, and cybernetic theory.
	- “Swarmachines” - Another zine-like publication, reflecting the CCRU’s fascination with swarm intelligence and collective behavior in cybernetic systems.
- **Influence**: Although the CCRU was relatively short-lived, its impact has been enduring, influencing fields such as speculative realism, contemporary philosophy, and media theory. The group’s work has also inspired contemporary artists and musicians interested in the relationship between technology and culture.  
	- **Post-Warwick**: After the group’s activities at Warwick ceased, many former members continued to develop their ideas independently, contributing to academic and cultural discourse in various capacities.
	- **Resurgence of Interest**: In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the CCRU’s work, with reprints of their writings and new analyses of their influence on contemporary thought.
