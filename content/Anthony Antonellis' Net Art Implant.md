I found this project extremely interesting, and something to think about in terms of [[Post Internet Art]]. Anthony Antonellis created this implant that goes into his skin and has a simple gif that can be transfered to anyone via [[NFC technology]].

# Interesting Points
## Longevity
You might wonder, what happens when the thing dies and it's in his body?
Answer: actually you don't have to worry about that, because NFC chips don't require power. They are powered by a magnetic field generated by the reader's device.
## Oooo Scary!
Watching the video of him getting the chip implanted made head spin. Specifically, the part where the MASSIVE fucking needle *popped* through his skin. ü§¢

Anthony actually had nightmares (wonder why!) after getting the implant, despite the healing process going well.

> ‚ÄúThe most disturbing part was the series of bizarre dreams I had about the implant rejecting. In one, I dreamt the implant bounced around and loosened the skin on my hand until it became baggy like a wet leather glove. Later, I dreamt the implant migrated its way up my index finger and popped out through my fingernail. In reality the chip hasn‚Äôt moved a millimeter from where it was inserted. After about a week the swelling went away and it was healed save for a small scab. I thought the chip would feel hard like a Tic Tac, but since its below the skin in the subcutaneous tissue it‚Äôs very padded and feels not unlike a tendon.‚Äù

## Public Reaction
Anthony documented his "haters" on his tumblr blog ["But I feel great!"](https://butifeelgreat.tumblr.com). Some of these responses are so visceral and reactive.

## Questions relating to the piece.
- What does this piece say about ownership? Is this the only piece of technology that you can fully own? Or, is it just a cheap imitation of a USB but more deep literally and metaphorically. 
- What could this technology be considered? A tattoo? Will tons of people have this in the future?
- Can you become a hacker simply by waving your hand in front of things or holding someone's credit card?
